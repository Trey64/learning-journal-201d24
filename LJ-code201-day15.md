# LJ Code 201 - Day 15

Today we start planning for project week. I'm grouped up with Gabe and Joseph, and we all get along great. We're one of two groups that only has three people, which means more work, but I think we got this. We're going forward with Joseph's Battleship idea, and it's really exciting.

The guest speaker this afternoon gave an interesting presentation about finding the right company fit in the tech industry. I'm not sure which path I want to take just yet, but at least I have more insight into what it's like to work for a big company vs a start-up. After that, I watched the 401 Python presentations. Even though most of it was Greek to me, it was really cool seeing more complex projects come together and it gave me a feel for what to expect when my group presents next week. This weekend I'm gonna catch up on readings, take the test, and relax. It's the calm before the storm, so I gotta recharge my batteries while I still can.
