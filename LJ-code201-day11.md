# LJ Code 201 - Day 11

Today was a lot of work. It was pretty challenging getting the events functioning the way I wanted. User stories took a lot of time to think about, but they definitely help in breaking down a problem.

I didn't ask for much assistance this time around and my work suffered. I thought I could figure it out on my own but I definitely need help, so I shouldn't hesitate next time. The only way I'll learn is if I find out what I'm doing wrong and fix it. Anyways, I'm looking forward to the upcoming group project, so I'll start brainstorming some ideas soon.
