# LJ Code 201 - Day 10

So I just felt like Peter Griffin all day. That gif with him and the blinds is *so accurate.* CSS just doesn't cooperate with me, and whenever I get something just right, I mess something else up later. This was very apparent during the cookie pizza project. Trying to get all the assets to match up with the design was pretty challenging.

Of course, all of that frustrating can be minimized with a good wireframe. I see now how essential wireframes are. It was interesting learning to how to make them with the use of other resources, like a Lorem Ipsum generator and placeholder images. The professional approach is definitely more streamlined, and I will do my best going forward to take a similar approach when setting up a page.
