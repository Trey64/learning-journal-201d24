# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Today I did pair programming and my partner was Joseph Kim. It was a great collaborative process and I learned a lot. Joseph has prior experience and it shows.
He passed on a lot of new knowledge to me that helped me to understand functions better.

My Question 7 benefitted the most. It was very crude and repetitive, but it worked. The functions made it simpler and cleaner and now I know another way to accomplish the same thing. Overall it was a *great* day for learning and I got a lot of satisfaction from
partnering up and making something together.
