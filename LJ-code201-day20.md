# LJ Code 201 - Day 20

Presenting last was sort of a bummer, because you're freshest in people's mind once the day is over. Also, people may be tired of presentations by then and may not care as much. That being said, I think we did well. I'm very proud of my team and what we made, and I think we did a good job showing off our hard work. I did have a blunder when I got asked the "what did I learn about learning" question. I was *so* prepared for questions about stretch goals or what we'd like to change, so I was caught of guard and stammered out some generic answer that probably didn't even make sense. I'm not good at improvising on the spot. In hindsight, I should have let someone else answer while I thought of a reply. It was a learning experience for sure, just a slightly embarrassing one.

All the projects presented were awesome, though of course I'm gonna have a bias for my 201 classmates. But I really think they held up next to the 301 projects. The only real difference I saw was their use of APIs. I really enjoyed all of our classes projects because they were so unique and showed off everyone's talents in unique ways. This class has great people in it, and I'm glad I'll be seeing many of them return for the next course.
