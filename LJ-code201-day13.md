# LJ Code 201 - Day 13

So between the hours of coding and catching up on assignments, I haven't been sleeping well this week. Of course, I suppose that's par for the course in week 3. Or maybe my insomnia has just taken itself to the next level, who knows. Point is, I felt especially sluggish today and it just seemed like I wasn't grasping local storage very well. So I'm putting the blame on lack of sleep. At least, that's how I comfort myself after spending hours on the lab and then realizing that the solution was just a handful of lines of code.

Charts and buttons though. Those are my jam. Even after I've finished the lab goals, I obsessively tinkered with them until I realize *Oh crap I have a quiz to do!* So imagine my surprise when I discover that the quiz isn't multiple choice, but a single question where I have to write more code.

Good stuff. My brain begs for mercy, yet it craves more knowledge. Maybe I'll read a chapter before bed. *Oh crap I should eat!*
