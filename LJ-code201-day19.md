# LJ Code 201 - Day 19

Today we added some stretch goals and rehearsed presentations. Once medium and hard difficulty were working, it was time to edit the SweetAlerts. These alerts were Gabe's idea, and Joseph was the one who got them working. These completely replaced my canvas stuff that I worked so hard on yesterday. However, it was best for the project, so I had no problem canning it. It just sucks that I spent valuable time on something that ended up not mattering, when I could have used that time to complete another stretch goal, like a high score page or sound effects.

Still, I had time to touch up our About Us and game pages. It was cool to add Open Graph meta tags and favicons, two things I've always been aware of, but only really just learned about today.

After rehearsing our presentation in front of the TA's, we knew that we needed to be more structured. So we scribbled down some talking points and rehearsed again and again in the back of the building. All that open space came in handy! Also, can I just say that the table back there is just the best. Having a window to look out of really helps to ease the mind.

So pumped to show off our project to the school tomorrow! I'm proud of what the three of us have accomplished in just four days, and hopefully our fellow students will like it too.
