# LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Today was a much needed breather. Once I got my table rendering properly, I left it alone. I was going to tackle some stretch goals, but styling my index.html took up most of my day. I needed the CSS practice anyways, and it was great having the time to experiment.

The labs over the past couple of days have been intense, but it was an incredible learning experience. Every mistake gave me a better understanding of my code. And the code reviews were full of detailed information that I really benefitted from.
