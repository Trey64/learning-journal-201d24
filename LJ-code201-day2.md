# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Today I got to create a GitHub repo and practice Add, Commit, and Push. I can
see the importance of regular commits. My project consisted of an HTML, CSS,
and JS files. It was cool putting my knowledge into practice to see how each
file interacts with each other. The JS portion was difficult, and it took me
a while to figure out that I could insert .toLowerCase() in the if/else
statement. It was very rewarding to solve the problem and see things start
to come together. Things got a lot smoother after that, although I found CSS
tedious and time-consuming because I had to keep checking references.

All in all, a very successful second day! This is all brand new to me, and I'm
glad to see some of it clicking.
