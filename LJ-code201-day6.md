# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

So today's lab was about using object literals to solve a problem domain. I learned to use Math.floor() and Math.random() to generate random numbers. This part was difficult and I had 3 TA's helping me out, which was simultaneously frustrating and amusing. Eventually we got it working but I honestly can't remember how the problem started or how we solved it! I should have taken notes, in case this issue pops up again in the future.

I was able to figure out the rest, with Teddy's help. After that, things clicked and the rest of it went pretty smoothly. This was not something I could ever have done alone, so I definitely need more practice with object literals and using methods. The finished product makes sense now, but I struggled beforehand.
