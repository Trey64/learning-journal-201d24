# LJ Code 201 - Day 17

Today we made great progress on our Battleship project. We all work really well together, and we all have unique specialties that contribute to the overall project. For three people, I gotta say this went better than I thought. At first it seemed that having fewer people was a disadvantage, but everyone is pulling their weight. I've had the most fun experimenting with animations and other visual stuff. The javascript is the most difficult part, but we're in a good spot at the moment. We're already tackling stretch goals, and the pace isn't rushed.
